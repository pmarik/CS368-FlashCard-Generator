# CS368-FlashCard-Generator
CS368 Class Project

Program flow: Compile and run all files in the same directory. We have provided two sample word-definition lists to start out the program ("example_word-definitions_long.txt" and "example_word-definitions_short.txt"). The Flashcard Generator has a welcome screen that prompts for a new username or to load a previous username with associated data. The program will then confirm if this name is the correct one the user wants. From there the program has a main menu with options to 'Review Cards,' 'Edit Decks,' 'Generate Cards,' and 'Quit.' Reviewing cards allows a user to choose from a list of study decks with flashcards in them. A user picks which deck they would like to study from and a prompt with the definition is shown. The user enters the word and they will be notified if they got the correct answer or not. The program will give the option to continue to re-study the same material or will exit to the main menu based on the user's input. 
  'Edit Decks' allows a user to pick again from their list of decks and manipulate it in various ways. This includes a few options that are given in another menu. The menu includes options to add a card, delete a card, change a word, modify a definiton, and change the name of a deck, as well as quit back to the main menu. Adding a card allows a user to choose a word and definition pair to be added to the deck. Deleting a card will remove the chosen card from the list of cards within a deck. Changing a word allows a user to pick a new word to match a definition, and modifying a definition does the same for changing a definition to a preivous word.
   'Generate Cards' allows a user to enter in a file name of a text document (saved in the current directory of the Flashcard Generator program). The text document will have data associated with decks, words, and definitions to generate new decks and flashcards. The program will pull this data from the file and create a new deck with flashcards which can be used to study and manipulated in the other menus.
   'Quit' offers a user the prompt to save their current decks associated with their username. If a user enters 'yes' to save their deck then the program will create a new file named by their username in the directory of the Flashcard Generator. The file will be formated to have appropriate decks, words, and definitions. This file can then be loaded back into the program if the user decides to study again at a later time. The program will terminate function after the file is wrote, and will also do so if a user decideds not to save their current flashcard decks.
